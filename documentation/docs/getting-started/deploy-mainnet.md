# Deploy to Mainnet

Deploying to Stellar mainnet is a one-way door: **there is no undo**. Bugs ship with real financial consequences, and the cost to remediate a vulnerability after deployment is always higher than the cost to prevent it before. This guide walks through every stage of a production deployment — from pre-deploy verification through post-deploy monitoring — with explicit safety controls at each step.

> **Complete [Deploy to Testnet](./deploy-testnet.md) first.** Every step in this guide assumes your contract has been deployed, invoked, and fully validated on testnet.

---

## Stage 1: Pre-deploy checklist

Work through every item on this checklist before touching mainnet. Do not skip items and do not deploy if any item is unresolved.

### Code quality

- [ ] All unit tests pass: `cargo test`
- [ ] All integration tests pass against a local or testnet environment
- [ ] No compiler warnings in the production codebase (`RUSTFLAGS="-D warnings" cargo build`)
- [ ] Contract WASM size is within on-chain limits (≤ 64 KB compressed after `stellar contract optimize`)
- [ ] Dependency audit passed: `cargo audit` returns no high-severity findings

### Security review

- [ ] Every public function that mutates state is guarded by `require_auth` or equivalent
- [ ] All arithmetic uses `checked_*` methods or types with overflow protection
- [ ] State is updated **before** any cross-contract call (Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern)
- [ ] All user-supplied inputs are validated (amounts > 0, addresses not zero/self, no out-of-range values)
- [ ] No unbounded loops or collections that grow without limit
- [ ] At least one peer has reviewed the contract logic and the security assumptions
- [ ] Upgrade authority (if any) is locked to a hardware-wallet-controlled admin address

### Testnet validation

- [ ] Contract has been deployed to testnet and every function invoked at least once
- [ ] Error paths and edge cases tested (insufficient balance, unauthorized calls, boundary values)
- [ ] Cross-contract interactions validated end-to-end on testnet
- [ ] Events emitted as expected and decoded correctly
- [ ] Gas consumption per function is within expected budget
- [ ] Storage growth per operation is understood and bounded

### Operational readiness

- [ ] Contract ID will be recorded and backed up immediately after deployment
- [ ] Admin keypair is stored in a hardware wallet or multi-sig
- [ ] Monitoring strategy is in place (see [Stage 4](#stage-4-post-deploy-monitoring))
- [ ] Incident response plan is documented: who is notified, how the contract is paused or migrated
- [ ] Team has reviewed the [Security Fundamentals](../security/fundamentals.md) guide

---

## Stage 2: Configure for mainnet

### Generate and secure a mainnet keypair

Never reuse your testnet keypair on mainnet. Generate a dedicated mainnet identity:

```bash
stellar keys generate --global mainnet-deployer
```

View the public key:

```bash
stellar keys address mainnet-deployer
```

**Store the seed phrase offline.** The deployer key only needs to exist long enough to deploy and initialize the contract. After initialization, transfer admin rights to a hardware wallet address and delete or archive the deployer key.

### Fund the deployer account

Purchase XLM and send it to your deployer public key. You need enough XLM to cover:

- The **base reserve** (currently 0.5 XLM per ledger entry)
- **Transaction fees** for the deploy and initialization calls (typically a few stroop each)
- A buffer for unexpected retry fees

Check your balance before proceeding:

```bash
stellar account balance \
  --account mainnet-deployer \
  --network mainnet
```

### Add the mainnet network

```bash
stellar network add \
  --name mainnet \
  --rpc-url https://mainnet.stellar.validationcloud.io/v1/<your-key> \
  --network-passphrase "Public Global Stellar Network ; September 2015"
```

Public RPC endpoints are available from multiple providers (Validation Cloud, Ankr, Stellar Foundation). Use an endpoint you trust, or run your own Horizon/Soroban RPC node for production workloads.

Verify the network is configured:

```bash
stellar network ls
```

---

## Stage 3: Deploy

### Build the production artifact

Always build fresh immediately before deploying. Do not deploy a WASM file built earlier on a different machine.

```bash
cd my-contract
stellar contract build
```

Verify the artifact:

```bash
ls -lh target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/my_contract.optimized.wasm
```

Record the SHA-256 hash of the artifact you are about to deploy. This hash is your audit trail:

```bash
sha256sum target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/my_contract.optimized.wasm
```

### Simulate the deployment first

Before spending real XLM, simulate the transaction to catch configuration errors:

```bash
stellar contract deploy \
  --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/my_contract.optimized.wasm \
  --source mainnet-deployer \
  --network mainnet \
  --sim-only
```

If simulation fails, investigate the error before proceeding.

### Deploy to mainnet

```bash
CONTRACT_ID=$(stellar contract deploy \
  --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/my_contract.optimized.wasm \
  --source mainnet-deployer \
  --network mainnet)

echo "Contract ID: $CONTRACT_ID"
```

> **Record the Contract ID immediately.** Write it to a file, your incident runbook, and your monitoring configuration. A lost Contract ID cannot be recovered — you would need to re-deploy.

```bash
echo "$CONTRACT_ID" > mainnet-contract-id.txt
```

### Initialize the contract

Most production contracts require an initialization call to set the admin address, initial state, or configuration:

```bash
stellar contract invoke \
  --id "$CONTRACT_ID" \
  --source mainnet-deployer \
  --network mainnet \
  -- initialize \
  --admin <hardware-wallet-public-key> \
  --other-param <value>
```

> **Set the admin to a hardware wallet or multi-sig address**, not the deployer keypair. The deployer keypair should have no further power after initialization.

### Verify the deployment

Confirm the contract is live and the initialization is correct:

```bash
# Inspect the on-chain contract metadata
stellar contract inspect \
  --id "$CONTRACT_ID" \
  --network mainnet
```

Invoke a read-only function to verify state:

```bash
stellar contract invoke \
  --id "$CONTRACT_ID" \
  --source mainnet-deployer \
  --network mainnet \
  -- get_admin
```

Cross-check on a block explorer:

- [Stellar Expert (mainnet)](https://stellar.expert/explorer/public)
- Search for your Contract ID or deployer account address

## Stage 4: Post-deploy monitoring

Deployment is not the end of your responsibilities — it is the beginning. A contract that no one is watching is a contract waiting to be exploited.

### What to monitor

| Signal | Why it matters |
|---|---|
| Transaction volume per function | Sudden spikes may indicate an exploit attempt or bot activity |
| Failed transaction rate | Rising errors can signal unexpected inputs or state corruption |
| Contract balance / token holdings | Unexplained outflows require immediate investigation |
| Event emissions | Missing or unexpected events reveal logic anomalies |
| Admin actions | Any unauthorized admin call is a critical incident |
| Storage growth | Unbounded growth leads to eventual DoS via fee escalation |

### How to monitor

**Stellar Expert alerts** — set up address watchers on [stellar.expert](https://stellar.expert/explorer/public) for your contract address and admin address.

**Horizon streaming** — subscribe to the transactions endpoint for your contract:

```bash
curl "https://horizon.stellar.org/accounts/<CONTRACT_ID>/transactions?cursor=now" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream"
```

**Custom scripts** — poll the Soroban RPC for ledger entry changes and event history:

```bash
# Fetch recent events for your contract
stellar events \
  --id "$CONTRACT_ID" \
  --network mainnet \
  --count 100
```

**Third-party services** — platforms such as Nansen, Dune, or custom Grafana dashboards can be pointed at Stellar data feeds for sustained production monitoring.

### Setting up alerts

At minimum, configure alerts for:

1. Any call to admin-only functions (mint, upgrade, set_admin)
2. Token balance dropping below a threshold
3. Transaction failure rate exceeding 5 % in a 10-minute window
4. Storage entry count growing faster than expected

---

## Stage 5: Incident response

Even well-audited contracts encounter unexpected situations. Have a plan before you need it.

### Pause mechanisms

If your contract implements a pause flag, keep the admin keypair accessible for emergency use:

```bash
stellar contract invoke \
  --id "$CONTRACT_ID" \
  --source admin-hardware-wallet \
  --network mainnet \
  -- set_paused --paused true
```

If your contract does not implement pause, your options are limited to:
- Revoking allowances / approvals at the token level
- Communicating the issue publicly so users stop interacting
- Deploying a migration path if the contract is upgradeable

### Migration / upgrade

If your contract uses the [upgrade pattern](../patterns/lifecycle-upgrades.mdx):

```bash
# Build the patched contract
stellar contract build

# Upload the new WASM (gets a new hash)
stellar contract upload \
  --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/my_contract.optimized.wasm \
  --source admin-hardware-wallet \
  --network mainnet

# Invoke the upgrade entry point with the new hash
stellar contract invoke \
  --id "$CONTRACT_ID" \
  --source admin-hardware-wallet \
  --network mainnet \
  -- upgrade --new_wasm_hash <new-hash>
```

> **Test every upgrade on testnet first**, even under time pressure. A broken upgrade transaction on mainnet may be unrecoverable.

### Communication

- Announce incidents on your project's social channels promptly
- Provide a timeline and impact assessment within 24 hours
- Do not downplay the severity — users need accurate information to protect themselves

## Mainnet vs testnet: key differences

| Aspect | Testnet | Mainnet |
|---|---|---|
| XLM value | Free (Friendbot) | Real monetary value |
| Reset risk | Network resets periodically | Permanent — no resets |
| Contract ID persistence | May be lost after reset | Permanent |
| Fee urgency | Low | Can spike during congestion |
| Explorer | testnet.stellar.expert | stellar.expert |
| RPC endpoint | soroban-testnet.stellar.org | Provider-specific |
| Error cost | Low (no real value) | High (may be irreversible) |

---

## Security controls summary

| Control | Requirement |
|---|---|
| Testnet validation | Mandatory — all functions tested |
| Security review | Mandatory — at least one peer reviewer |
| `cargo audit` | Mandatory — no high-severity findings |
| Admin key storage | Hardware wallet or multi-sig |
| Deployer key lifecycle | Create → deploy → initialize → retire |
| Artifact hash recorded | Mandatory — recorded before deploy |
| Post-deploy verification | Mandatory — inspect + read-only call |
| Monitoring in place | Mandatory — before going live |
| Incident response plan | Documented before going live |
